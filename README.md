# External stylesheets and external javascript

In this lesson you'll be rendering gifs!

Right now, index.html shows a cat gif.
Each of the linked pages, however,
has a problem keeping the gifs from rendering.

Your job is to make the correct gifs appear on each of the following pages:

* `pages/drake.html`
* `pages/kanye.html`
* `pages/rihanna.html`

Each page has a different problem. The folks at HQ dropped the
ball, now it's up to YOU to make the pages right again.
