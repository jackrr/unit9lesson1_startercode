# External stylesheets and external javascript

In this lesson you'll be rendering gifs!

## Step 1: Show the gifs

Right now, index.html shows a cat gif.
Each of the linked pages, however,
has a problem keeping the gifs from rendering.

Your job is to make the correct gifs appear on each of the following pages:

* `pages/drake.html`
* `pages/kanye.html`
* `pages/rihanna.html`

Each page has a different problem. The folks at HQ dropped the
ball, now it's up to YOU to make the pages right again.

## Step 2: Nice links

Now that you have the gifs showing, don't you think
the pages lack some color? Well, the suits at HQ do.

So you need to make each page POP a little more. Specifically,
you are going to:

* make the headers white with a light blue backgound
* make the anchor tags red

And here's the catch. HQ wants this done with as little CSS as possible.
You're going to make one CSS file and use it to style every page!

Good luck!

## Step 3: Extra credit

Wow! HQ is very pleased with your colorful pages.
Now they have a final request.

Your underlined anchor tags look like someone made them 15 years ago!
Let's bring them into 2016.

Your job is to make the anchor tags underlined
ONLY when you hover over them with your mouse.
Here's a hint: google "css hover selector".
